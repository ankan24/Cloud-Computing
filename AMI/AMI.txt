Introduction:
Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a virtual machine template that includes an OS, application software, and configurations for launching EC2 instances.

Steps to Create and Use AWS AMI:

1. Create an AMI from an EC2 Instance:
   - Open AWS Console → EC2 Dashboard → Instances.
   - Select an instance → Click "Actions" → "Create Image".
   - Provide a name and description → Click "Create Image".
   - Wait for AMI creation under the "AMIs" section.

2. Launch an EC2 Instance from an AMI:
   - Open AWS Console → EC2 Dashboard → AMIs.
   - Select an AMI → Click "Launch".
   - Choose an instance type → Configure settings.
   - Click "Launch" to create an EC2 instance from the AMI.

3. Use AWS CLI for AMI Management:
   - Create an AMI:
     aws ec2 create-image --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --name "MyCustomAMI" --no-reboot
   - List available AMIs:
     aws ec2 describe-images --owners self
   - Deregister an AMI:
     aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890

Benefits of AWS AMI:
- Faster Deployment: Quickly launch pre-configured EC2 instances.
- Customizability: Create custom AMIs with specific applications.
- Scalability: Easily launch multiple identical instances.
- Cost Savings: Saves time in configuring new instances.
- Backup & Recovery: Use AMIs as backups for EC2 instances.
