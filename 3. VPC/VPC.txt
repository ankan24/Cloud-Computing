Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Introduction:
Amazon VPC allows users to create a secure and isolated cloud network for AWS resources.

Steps to Create a VPC:
1. Sign in to AWS Console → Navigate to VPC Dashboard
2. Click "Create VPC" → Enter name and CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
3. Enable IPv6 (optional) → Choose tenancy → Click "Create VPC"

Creating Subnets:
1. Go to "Subnets" → Click "Create Subnet"
2. Select the VPC, choose an Availability Zone, and enter a CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24)
3. Click "Create Subnet"

Creating an Internet Gateway:
1. Go to "Internet Gateways" → Click "Create IGW"
2. Attach the IGW to the VPC

Configuring Route Tables:
1. Go to "Route Tables" → Click "Create Route Table"
2. Associate it with the VPC
3. Add a route for 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to the IGW

Modifying Security Groups & NACLs:
1. Go to "Security Groups" → Modify inbound/outbound rules
2. Allow necessary traffic (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
3. Configure Network ACLs for additional security

Benefits of VPC:
- Isolation: Private and secure network
- Custom Networking: Define IP ranges, subnets, and routing
- Scalability: Easily expand with new subnets
- Security: Use security groups, NACLs, and VPNs
- Integration: Works with EC2, RDS, Lambda, and other AWS services
