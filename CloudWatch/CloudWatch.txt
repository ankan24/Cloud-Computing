Introduction:
AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects metrics, logs, and alerts for AWS resources.

Steps to Create and Use AWS CloudWatch:

1. Access CloudWatch:
   - Open AWS Console â†’ CloudWatch.

2. Create a CloudWatch Alarm:
   - Open Alarms in CloudWatch.
   - Click "Create Alarm".
   - Select a Metric (e.g., EC2 CPU Utilization).
   - Set a Threshold (e.g., trigger an alarm if CPU > 80%).
   - Choose an Action (e.g., send an SNS notification).
   - Click "Create Alarm".

3. Monitor Logs using CloudWatch Logs:
   - Open "Log Groups" in CloudWatch.
   - Click "Create Log Group".
   - Configure "Log Streams" to collect logs from EC2, Lambda, etc.

4. Enable CloudWatch Metrics:
   - Metrics appear automatically for AWS services like EC2, S3, and RDS.
   - Click "Metrics" in CloudWatch to explore performance statistics.

5. Use AWS CLI for CloudWatch:
   - List CloudWatch metrics:
     aws cloudwatch list-metrics
   - Create an Alarm:
     aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name HighCPUUsage --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace AWS/EC2 --statistic Average --threshold 80 --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-1234567890abcdef0 --evaluation-periods 1 --period 300 --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:myTopic --unit Percent
   - View logs:
     aws logs describe-log-groups

Benefits of AWS CloudWatch:
- Real-time Monitoring: Tracks AWS resource health.
- Automated Alarms: Notifies when performance thresholds are exceeded.
- Log Management: Stores logs for debugging.
- Cost Optimization: Analyzes usage and optimizes costs.
- Integration: Works with AWS EC2, Lambda, RDS, and S3.
