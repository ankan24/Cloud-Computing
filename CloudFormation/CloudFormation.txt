AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that enables you to model, provision, and manage AWS resources using templates.

Creating CloudFormation Templates:
- Templates are written in YAML or JSON format
- Define resources using AWS resource types
- Specify properties for each resource
- Templates can include parameters, mappings, conditions, and outputs

Using CloudFormation:
- Templates can be deployed via console, CLI, or API
- Resources are created in the correct order based on dependencies
- Changes can be previewed before applying
- Resources can be updated, replaced, or deleted as needed

Benefits:
- Single source of truth for infrastructure
- Version control for infrastructure
- Consistent and repeatable deployments
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Built-in validation and rollback capabilities
- Infrastructure documentation
- Change tracking and management
- Cost estimation before deployment
- Cross-region and cross-account deployment support
- Integration with AWS service catalog
