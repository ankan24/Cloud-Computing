AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Introduction:
AWS IAM helps manage access to AWS services securely. It allows creating users, groups, and roles with permissions.

Steps to Create and Use IAM:

1. Create an IAM User:
   - Sign in to AWS Console and go to IAM.
   - Click "Users" → "Add user".
   - Enter a username and select "Access key - Programmatic access".
   - Assign permissions (AdministratorAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess).
   - Click "Create user" and download the access key.

2. Create an IAM Group:
   - Click "Groups" → "Create group".
   - Assign permissions (AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonRDSFullAccess).
   - Add users to the group.

3. Create an IAM Role:
   - Click "Roles" → "Create role".
   - Select a trusted entity (e.g., AWS service like EC2).
   - Attach a policy (AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess).
   - Create the role and assign it to a service.

4. Attach an IAM Policy:
   - Click "Policies" → "Create Policy".
   - Example JSON Policy for S3 Access:
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "s3:*",
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
     }
   - Attach policy to users, groups, or roles.

Benefits of AWS IAM:
- Granular Access Control: Set fine-grained permissions.
- Secure Authentication: Uses MFA and temporary credentials.
- Role-Based Access: Assign roles to AWS services.
- Auditing & Monitoring: Tracks access with AWS CloudTrail.
