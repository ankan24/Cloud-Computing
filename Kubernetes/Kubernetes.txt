KUBERNETES
==========

DESCRIPTION:
-----------
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Initially designed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes provides a portable, extensible platform for managing containerized workloads and services, facilitating both declarative configuration and automation.

CREATION STEPS:
--------------
1. Install a container runtime (Docker, containerd, CRI-O)
2. Install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl tools
3. Initialize the control plane with kubeadm
4. Set up a pod network add-on
5. Join worker nodes to the cluster
6. Verify cluster status
7. Deploy sample applications

BENEFITS:
--------
- Container orchestration automation
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Horizontal scaling of applications
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Automated rollouts and rollbacks
- Self-healing capabilities
- Storage orchestration
- Secret and configuration management
- Batch execution processing
- Extensible architecture with plugins
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Cloud provider agnostic

USE CASES:
---------
- Microservices architecture
- Containerized application deployment
- Cloud-native applications
- DevOps and CI/CD pipelines
- Highly available applications
- Stateful applications and databases
- Batch processing and scheduled jobs
- Machine learning workloads
- Edge computing and IoT deployments
- Multi-cloud and hybrid deployments

COMPONENTS:
----------
CONTROL PLANE:
- API Server: Front-end for Kubernetes control plane
- etcd: Distributed key-value store for cluster data
- Scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes
- Controller Manager: Runs controller processes
- Cloud Controller Manager: Interfaces with cloud providers

NODE COMPONENTS:
- Kubelet: Agent ensuring containers are running in pods
- Kube-proxy: Maintains network rules on nodes
- Container Runtime: Responsible for running containers

OBJECTS:
- Pods: Smallest deployable units
- Services: Network abstraction for pod access
- Volumes: Storage abstraction
- Namespaces: Virtual clusters
- ReplicaSets: Pod replication controllers
- Deployments: Declarative updates for pods
- StatefulSets: For stateful applications
- DaemonSets: Ensures pods run on all nodes
- Jobs and CronJobs: For batch processing
- ConfigMaps and Secrets: Configuration management

NETWORKING:
- Pod networking model
- Service networking
- Ingress controllers
- Network policies
- DNS service discovery

LIMITATIONS:
-----------
- Complexity for simple applications
- Steep learning curve
- Resource overhead for small deployments
- Stateful application challenges
- Legacy application compatibility issues
- Need for proper monitoring and observability tools
- Difficult troubleshooting for beginners
- Security requires careful configuration

ALTERNATIVES:
-----------
- Docker Swarm: Simpler alternative
- Apache Mesos: For large-scale clusters
- Nomad by HashiCorp: Lightweight orchestrator
- OpenShift: Enterprise Kubernetes distribution
- Amazon ECS: AWS-specific container orchestration
- Azure Container Instances: Serverless containers
- Google Cloud Run: Serverless containers
- Rancher: Kubernetes management platform
