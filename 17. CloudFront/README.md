# AWS CloudFront

## Overview
Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

## How to Create and Use CloudFront

### Creating a CloudFront Distribution

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Origin
1. Set up your origin server (e.g., S3 bucket, EC2 instance, ALB, custom origin)
2. Ensure proper access permissions
3. Organize your content appropriately

#### Step 2: Create a CloudFront Distribution
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to CloudFront service
3. Click "Create Distribution"
4. Choose distribution type (Web or RTMP)
5. Configure origin settings:
   - Origin domain name
   - Origin path (optional)
   - Origin ID
   - Origin custom headers (optional)
6. Configure cache behavior settings:
   - Path pattern
   - Viewer protocol policy (HTTP/HTTPS)
   - Allowed HTTP methods
   - Cache and origin request settings
   - TTL settings
7. Configure distribution settings:
   - Price class
   - AWS WAF web ACL (optional)
   - Alternate domain names (CNAMEs) (optional)
   - SSL certificate (if using custom domain)
   - Default root object
   - Logging configuration
8. Review and create distribution

#### Step 3: Configure DNS (for Custom Domain)
1. Get your CloudFront distribution domain name
2. Update your DNS records to point to the CloudFront distribution
3. Wait for DNS propagation

#### Step 4: Test and Optimize
1. Test content delivery through CloudFront URL
2. Monitor performance using CloudWatch metrics
3. Adjust settings as needed for optimal performance

### Using CloudFront Features

#### Cache Invalidation
- Invalidate files when content updates
- Use wildcard invalidations for batch updates

#### Origin Groups for High Availability
