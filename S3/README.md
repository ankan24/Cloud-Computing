# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

## Introduction
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable cloud storage solution that allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.

## Steps to Create an S3 Bucket
1. **Sign in to AWS Console**  
   - Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)  
   - Navigate to **S3 Dashboard**  

2. **Create an S3 Bucket**  
   - Click on **Create Bucket**  
   - Enter a **Bucket Name** (must be globally unique)  
   - Choose a **Region** (nearest to your users)  
   - Set **Public Access Settings** (By default, block all public access)  
   - Choose **Versioning** (optional but recommended for backups)  
   - Click **Create Bucket**  

3. **Upload Files to S3**  
   - Open the bucket  
   - Click **Upload**  
   - Add files and configure permissions (public or private)  
   - Click **Upload**  

4. **Access S3 Objects**  
   - Click on a file to get the **Object URL**  
   - If public, anyone can access it via the URL  
   - If private, you need **IAM permissions or presigned URLs**  

5. **Manage S3 Storage**  
   - Enable **Lifecycle Policies** to auto-delete old files  
   - Use **Glacier Storage** for cold storage to save costs  
   - Set up **Cross-Region Replication** for backup
