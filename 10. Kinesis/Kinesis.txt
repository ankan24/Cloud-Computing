AWS Kinesis

AWS Kinesis is a platform for streaming data on AWS that makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data.

Kinesis Services:
- Kinesis Data Streams: for collecting and processing large streams of data records in real-time
- Kinesis Data Firehose: for loading streaming data into AWS data stores
- Kinesis Data Analytics: for processing and analyzing streaming data with SQL or Apache Flink
- Kinesis Video Streams: for streaming video from connected devices

Creating and Using Kinesis Data Streams:
- Create a stream with specified name and shard count
- Producers send data to the stream using API calls or libraries
- Consumers read data from the stream using the Kinesis Client Library or Lambda
- Data retention can be configured between 24 hours and 365 days
- Shards determine throughput capacity of the stream

Creating and Using Kinesis Data Firehose:
- Create a delivery stream with a specified destination
- Configure buffer size, buffer interval, and data transformation
- Send data directly to Firehose or via Kinesis Data Streams
- Data automatically delivered to destinations like S3, Redshift, or Elasticsearch

Creating and Using Kinesis Data Analytics:
- Create an application with input from Kinesis streams or Firehose
- Write SQL queries to analyze streaming data in real-time
- Configure output to Kinesis streams, Firehose, or Lambda
